# Small_EPS_Study
This repository contains code to estimate the efficiency of a test scintillator as a function of threshold. The data is collected from an oscilloscope when a trigger is formed with three other paddles. The binary data is read from .trc file and the individual pulses are stored in histogram using oscill_bin.C. The charge is estimated using charge.C
